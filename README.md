# Code_Refactor

## **About**

This website has been refactored to be more accessible to people with disabilities. It can be accessed easily with assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. I incorporated the use of html and css codes in designing the webpage.
I have made sure all the links works as they should and also included alt attributes to the images for the case of the visually impaired or bad network connections. This websites helps to tackle the problems of people with disabilities feeling limited to access webpages. I made sure to consolidate the selectors and properties making them follow the sematic structure of the HTML elements, and included comments before each section. Below includes the screenshot, url of the website and url of the repository.
